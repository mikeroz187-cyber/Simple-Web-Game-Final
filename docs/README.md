# Project Documentation

This folder contains all planning and design documentation for **Studio Empire**, including the current MVP implementation guides and the long-term design vision.

## Documentation Authority
- **MVP implementation is governed by specific docs** (listed below). Any feature not described in those documents is out of scope for the MVP.
- Primary MVP docs (authoritative):
  - **CURRENT_SCOPE.md** – Single source of truth for current scope/features.
  - **15-mvp-scope.md** – Defines the MVP feature set and boundaries.
  - **21-technical-implementation-guardrails.md** – Technical rules and limitations for MVP.
  - **22-file-and-folder-map.md** – Expected project structure and file organization for MVP.
  - **23-mvp-build-order.md** – Recommended order of implementation steps for MVP.
  - **24-ui-blueprint.md** – UI components and layout guidelines for the MVP interface.
  - **25-mvp-state-and-flow.md** – Authoritative definition of game state and flow for MVP.
- If something is described in older vision docs but not in the MVP docs, treat it as **out of scope** for now.
