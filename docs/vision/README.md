# Vision Documentation

This folder contains the full game design for Studio Empire.

## Important

These docs describe the COMPLETE game vision, not the MVP.

DO NOT implement features from this folder unless they also appear in `/docs/mvp/`.

## Purpose

- Reference for future development
- Context for understanding the full game
- Planning for post-MVP updates

## When MVP is Complete

Features from these docs will be moved into MVP scope incrementally.
